# BattleShip
A two player battleship game using python and tkinter. To run open the .py file and run it, I ran it on the application thonny.
Gameplay depends on players clicking the squares of the board to indicate where they want to shoot their shots. Game runs until a player has hit all of the other players ships. Ari Gardner, arigardner11@gmail.com
